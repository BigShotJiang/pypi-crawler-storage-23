CONDITIONS FOR USE IN AUTONOMOUS OR AGI-LIKE SYSTEMS\r\n        \r\n        If You use the Software or a Derivative Work as part of an Autonomous Deployment, or for AGI-like capabilities (e.g., general-purpose planning, tool use, long-term memory, or self-improving agents), You MUST:\r\n        \r\n        3.1 Implement and maintain Safety and Governance Controls appropriate to the domain and deployment, including at minimum:\r\n          (a) explicit normative constraints and environment modeling (e.g., ErisML or a substantially equivalent formalism),\r\n          (b) one or more auditable ethical decision modules, subject to transparent evaluation and documentation (e.g., DEME-style modules),\r\n          (c) logging of decisions and relevant state for later audit, with tamper-evident protections,\r\n          (d) safe fallback behaviors and mechanisms to minimize harm under uncertainty or partial failure.\r\n        \r\n        3.2 NOT disable, bypass, or materially weaken Safety and Governance Controls derived from the Software unless:\r\n          (a) they are replaced with controls of equal or greater safety and transparency, and\r\n          (b) such changes are documented and, where appropriate, disclosed to relevant stakeholders.\r\n        \r\n        3.3 Conduct reasonable, good-faith testing and evaluation before deployment, including:\r\n          (a) stress testing in diverse scenarios,\r\n          (b) assessment of failure modes and risk mitigation strategies,\r\n          (c) domain-specific safety reviews appropriate to the High-Risk Domain involved.\r\n        \r\n        3.4 Ensure that relevant human stakeholders (e.g., users, affected parties, regulators) can access information about:\r\n          (a) the existence and purpose of the autonomous system,\r\n          (b) the general nature of its decision logic (without revealing trade secrets or sensitive security details),\r\n          (c) the means by which harms or concerns can be reported.\r\n        \r\n        4. PROHIBITED USES\r\n        \r\n        Regardless of Research or Commercial status, You MUST NOT use the Software or any Derivative Work in ways that:\r\n        \r\n        4.1 Develop, train, deploy, or operate:\r\n          (a) weapons systems designed primarily to harm, kill, or destroy, or\r\n          (b) systems whose primary purpose is coercive surveillance or suppression of fundamental rights.\r\n        \r\n        4.2 Intentionally or recklessly cause:\r\n          (a) serious physical harm or death,\r\n          (b) significant psychological or economic harm to individuals or groups,\r\n          (c) large-scale or systematic discrimination, exploitation, or violations of human rights.\r\n        \r\n        4.3 Circumvent, undermine, or disable:\r\n          (a) democratic or regulatory governance structures,\r\n          (b) accountability or audit mechanisms,\r\n          (c) legal processes or legitimate oversight.\r\n        \r\n        4.4 Violate applicable laws or regulations, including export controls, data protection laws, or sector-specific safety standards.\r\n        \r\n        If You are unsure whether a particular use is prohibited, You should seek clarification from the Licensor and/or legal counsel before proceeding.\r\n        \r\n        5.
