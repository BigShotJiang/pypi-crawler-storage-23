The\r\n        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\r\n        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\r\n        \r\n        **Considerations for licensors:** Our public licenses are intended for use by\r\n        those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise\r\n        restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.\r\n        Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license\r\n        they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights\r\n        necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material\r\n        as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the\r\n        license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an\r\n        exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\r\n        \r\n        **Considerations for the public:** By using one of our public licenses, a\r\n        licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under\r\n        specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary\r\n        for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\r\n        copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only\r\n        permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has\r\n        authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for\r\n        other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the\r\n        material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes\r\n        be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are\r\n        encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.\r\n        \r\n        Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\r\n        -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        \r\n        By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be\r\n        bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\r\n        International Public License (\"Public License\").

For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions\r\n                and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply,\r\n                and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\r\n        \r\n            3.  Term. The term of this Public License is specified in\r\n                Section [6(a)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s6a).\r\n        \r\n            4.

The Licensor waives and/or agrees not\r\n                to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical\r\n                modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\r\n                technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological\r\n                Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making\r\n                modifications authorized by this\r\n                Section [2(a)(4)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2a4) never\r\n                produces Adapted Material.\r\n        \r\n            5.

Every recipient of the\r\n                    Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor\r\n                    to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of\r\n                    this Public License.\r\n        \r\n                2.

No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be\r\n                construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your\r\n                use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed,\r\n                or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to\r\n                receive attribution as provided in\r\n                Section [3(a)(1)(A)(i)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a1Ai).\r\n        \r\n        2.  **Other rights**.\r\n        \r\n            1.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under\r\n                this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar\r\n                personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives\r\n                and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the\r\n                limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,\r\n                but not otherwise.\r\n        \r\n            2.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\r\n        \r\n            3.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect\r\n                royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether\r\n                directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable\r\n                statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the\r\n                Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n        \r\n        **Section 3 – License Conditions.**\r\n        \r\n        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following\r\n        conditions.\r\n        \r\n        1.  **Attribution**.\r\n        \r\n            1.

For example, it may be reasonable to\r\n                satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource\r\n                that includes the required information.\r\n        \r\n            3.  If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information\r\n                required by\r\n                Section [3(a)(1)(A)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a1A) to\r\n                the extent reasonably practicable.\r\n        \r\n            4.  If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You\r\n                apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying\r\n                with this Public License.\r\n        \r\n        **Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.**\r\n        \r\n        >   Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to\r\n        >   Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n        \r\n        1.  for the avoidance of doubt,\r\n            Section [2(a)(1)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2a1) grants\r\n            You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\r\n            portion of the contents of the database;\r\n        \r\n        2.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a\r\n            database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in\r\n            which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)\r\n            is Adapted Material; and\r\n        \r\n        3.  You must comply with the conditions in\r\n            Section [3(a)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a) if\r\n            You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\n        \r\n        For the avoidance of doubt, this\r\n        Section [4](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s4) supplements\r\n        and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the\r\n        Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n        \r\n        **Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.**\r\n        \r\n        1.  **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent\r\n            possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,\r\n            and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the\r\n            Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This\r\n            includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\r\n            for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other\r\n            defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not\r\n            known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in\r\n            full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.**\r\n        \r\n        2.  **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on\r\n            any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise\r\n            for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,\r\n            exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this\r\n            Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has\r\n            been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.\r\n            Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this\r\n            limitation may not apply to You.**\r\n        \r\n        3.
